# LEGO Store E-commerce Project ðŸ§©

## Description

This is a personal project aimed at building a LEGO store e-commerce website to improve my skills in web development.
The website will allow users to browse a collection of LEGO, add them to their cart, and complete their purchases securely online.

## Technologies Used

- Netx.JS: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications.
- Redux Toolkit: A set of tools and best practices for managing application state in Redux
- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling web applications.
- Stripe: Payment processing platform for handling online transactions securely.
- NextAuth : An authentication library for Next.JS applications, providing features like session management, OAuth authentication, and custom authentication strategies.
- MongoDB or Firebase: NoSQL database solutions for storing user data, product information, and order details.

## Project Goals

- Create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- Implement features such as :
  - product catalog
  - shopping cart
  - favorites products
  - user authentication with google account
  - and order management
  - Integrate Stripe for handling online payments securely.
  - Utilize MongoDB or Firebase or Supabase to store and manage user data and product information.
  - Gain practical experience with Next.JS, State management, databases and other modern web development technologies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
